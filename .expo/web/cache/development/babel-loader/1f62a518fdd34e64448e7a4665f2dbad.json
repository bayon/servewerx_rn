One major project was implementing a ‘gifting’ feature and creating a calendar for shipping the gifts.\"\n  //const codigoExperience=`At Codigo I created a digital signage app that would engage customers in the lobby of businesses, to post ‘thoughts’ and ‘images’ in real time according to ‘Campaign Themes’ set up by app administrators.\n  //It featured a backend for admin management , as well as a factory design pattern, designed to handle a variety of ‘animations’ involving the different types of text, images , and background elements that would be featured on screen, all moving at different rates of speed and at varying sizes. It also had a database polling feature which handled the ‘real time’ presentation of new posts. The backend was PHP and MySQL, while the frontend was mainly vanilla javascript and jQuery.`\n\n  //const advancedSolutionsExperience=`At Advanced Solutions I helped convert a variety of websites for their subsidiaries over to Wordpress, so that they could be more easily managed by the marketing department. I also encouraged the use of Docker to maintain a consistent environment for all of the sites.`\n  //const thinkfulExperience=`Thinkful is an online learning resource for modern web development skills. I mentored students in javascript and React. I also graded student work and provided feedback and guidance as to how to complete their tasks.

I’ve handled the server administration , as well as, managing a small group of developers remotely using Trello and BitBucket. We are using MySQL and an ORM called Sequelize that handles the database seeding and migrations. I also am writing the swift code for the iPhone client that will use the service and I will be guiding us through the iTunes store submission and deployment.`\n  //const adderMobileExperience=`Adder Mobile was a start-up. We started from scratch using different technology. I advised them on which technologies would serve us best. We decided on ReactJS for the frontend, NodeJS for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. We then began , at an urgent pace, building their system. With great coordination and teamwork, we had an MVP completed in approximately four months that the sales team was then able to begin explaining the service we had created more clearly to potential customers and investors. I believe the progress we made definitely influenced the investments that we received after the MVP was completed.`\n  //const eltoroExperience=`El Toro hired me just before the covid pandemic struck. They were growing rapidly and try also trying to increase their velocity in the development of a political portal, for targeted advertising, in time for this political season. I helped them make that happen as part of a large team of front end developers working in coordination with a separate API team, and other logistics teams as well. We were using a typescript version of React to create the frontend, along with SASS. I helped create UI tests with Selenium as well as some integration testing with puppeteer.\n  //After that project was completed I started working with another team in Quality Assurance creating API tests in both Postman and SoapUI. I also helped with the ‘automation’ of certain processes in our Atlassian suite mainly with Jira Service Desks, Boards, and Confluence spaces. I started using the ‘Go lang’ because we were using it to handle some of the processes in an AWS lambda.
